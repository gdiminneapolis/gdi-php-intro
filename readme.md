This is the official Girl Develop It PHP curriculum, initially developed by Sylvia Pellicore.

The course is meant to be taught in 4 two-hour sections. Each of the slides and practice files are customizable according to the needs of a given class or audience.

## Course description
PHP is the language that powers Facebook, Wikipedia, WordPress, and more--in fact, it is the most common server-side language on the web! You can use PHP to build interactive, dynamic websites. We will go over the basics of programming with PHP--variables, functions, loops, and more! We will also show you how to connect your code to a MySQL database. By the end of the class you will have a fully functional PHP website.

Many programming courses end up glossing over some of the tricky words -- 'variable', 'object', 'method' -- this course is especially designed for beginners new to programming concepts, so you'll learn to program with PHP. If those words are confusing to you now, no worries! You're exactly who we want to teach.
